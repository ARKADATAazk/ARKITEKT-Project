TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" means an individual or organization exercising permissions under this License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to the ARKITEKT toolkit, including the core library (arkitekt/),
example applications (apps/), and associated documentation.

"Modified Version" refers to any work based on the Program or any portion thereof.

"Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you
directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law.

"Convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program,
and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms
your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so
long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for
the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable
law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in
accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program,
in source code form under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any
   conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
   "keep intact all notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into
   possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
   however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices,
   your work need not make them do so.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided
that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions
from one or more of its conditions. You may place additional permissions on material, added by you
to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you
may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
with terms permitting preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.

11. Patents.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the
contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise
run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into
a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public
License from time to time. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local
legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program.
